# GRANDMA HELPER


After grandfather’s passing a few years ago, my grandmother’s been living by herself and has had to use a technology she knows nothing about to try and have daily interactions with the family. The process has been a little bit of a rollercoaster. While we all have very different life rhythms, the communication has been limited. My siblings live on different sides of the globe, so while my grandma’s having her afternoon tea, my sister is likely to be out partying or in the midst of a long night of sleep. Many times, this has resulted in getting calls at very inappropriate times (._.) 

And if we ever reply 

ERROR 404

This week has showed me a pathway that responds to problems while using very up to date methods. 
I had never previously worked with wires. 
Failing a simple task over and over again with the Arduino kit on the first day somehow put me in my grandmother’s shoes. 


Based on the lighting system of the Arduino, I had the idea of creating a ‘grandma helper’. This object would essentially present a more analog interface while still being connected to modern apps by plugging your phone to it. 

Main features are the following

let the user know if there is an issue – sound/connection/etc problem
asking for availability of correspondent 
-	sends the call to phone automatically if so 

Over the week, along with familiarizing myself with the Arduino as well as the creative computing pathway, I’ve worked on a short animation to present the previously mentioned issue. This also shows an animated prototype drawing of the device itself.
